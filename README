To do
=====

[x] MCMCResults class
  [x] Contains chain
  [x] Output posterior mean dict (warmup, thinning)
[x] Output results to MCMCResults
[x] Implement metrics
[x] Implement a function to output true values from generated data
[x] Implement saving and loading results
[x] Implement log-likelihood saving
[x] Implement TG sampling on GPU <=== very important
[x] Implement loading into arviz
[x] Check new truncated Gaussian
[x] Implement predictions
[x] Check sign flip & ordering
[x] Implement analytical marginalization & MAP
[x] Experiment with number of training repetitions
[x] Chain alignments
[x] Align true values to current chain (or vice versa)
[x] Implement a function to output true values from generated data
[ ] Finish estimation metrics
[ ] More Prediction metrics
[x] Entropy
[x] ESS


[ ] Tuning:
    - smoothness parameter
    - K
[ ] ESS along the 50K
[ ] Prediction, testing
[ ] DIC or BF / TEST
[ ] Posterior predictive check, bayesian p-value
     - check literature for important statistics
     - P300 feature extractions

[ ] Something is wrong with prediction
    - The issue is that we need to iterate until some convergence before
      we can predict; one step is really bad.
